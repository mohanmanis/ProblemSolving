Find minimum number of coins that make a given value
Given a value V, if we want to make change for V cents, and we have infinite supply of each of C = { C1, C2, .. , Cm} valued coins, what is the minimum number of coins to make the change? If itâ€™s not possible to make change, print -1.

Input: coins[] = {25, 10, 5}, V = 30
Output: Minimum 2 coins required
We can use one coin of 25 cents and one of 5 cents

Input: coins[] = {9, 6, 5, 1}, V = 11
Output: Minimum 2 coins required
We can use one coin of 6 cents and 1 coin of 5 cents

It is a variation of unbounded knapsack.
